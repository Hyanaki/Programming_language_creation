# Programming_language_creation

This project was achieved in 2017-2018 when I was student in France.

The purpose was to create a programing language to describe the graph of a scene.
A graph of a scene is made of 3D or 2D Geometry (Cube, Sphere...) where we can apply transformation such as Rotation, Translatation, Scale
 for each geometry or group of geometries.
